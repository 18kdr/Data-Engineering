### âš½ Premier League 2023/24 Dashboard (Power BI) - Data Engineering Project - 1

**Tools:** Python, PostgreSQL, Power BI  
**Focus:** Data pipeline + Visualization

**What I did:**
- Pulled live EPL data from a football API using Python
- Transformed it with Pandas and stored in PostgreSQL
- Connected Power BI to the database
- Built a branded, interactive dashboard showing team stats, standings, and KPIs

This project helped me apply both data engineering and data visualization skills in a real-world scenario â€” powered by my passion for football!
