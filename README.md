### âš½ Premier League 2023/24 Dashboard (Power BI) - Data Engineering Project - 1

**Tools:** Python, PostgreSQL, Power BI  
**Focus:** Data pipeline + Visualization

**What I did:**
- Pulled live EPL data from a football API using Python
- Transformed it with Pandas and stored in PostgreSQL
- Connected Power BI to the database
- Built a branded, interactive dashboard showing team stats, standings, and KPIs

This project helped me apply both data engineering and data visualization skills in a real-world scenario â€” powered by my passion for football!

### Tech Job Analysis - Data Engineering Project - 2

**Tools:** Python
**Libraries** Pandas, MatplotLib
**Focus:** Data Engineering + Visualization

**What I did:**
- Job Type Analysis â€“ Categorized job types into Full-Time, Contract, and Part-Time, and visualized using a horizontal bar chart.
- Job Location Insights â€“ Split location into City, State, and Country, standardized country values, and plotted with a horizontal bar chart.
- Pay Range Categorization â€“ Removed null pay values, classified into three pay bands, and visualized with a vertical bar chart.
- Job Portal Distribution â€“ Filtered out negligible values and displayed job portal distribution using a donut chart.

**Dataset details:**
Collected between October and December 2024, this dataset contains 100,000+ tech job listings from fields like Cyber Security, Software Engineering, IT, Product Management, and Data Science.
Jobs were scraped using JobsPy from major portals like Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and Glassdoor â€” then consolidated into one dataset for analysis.
